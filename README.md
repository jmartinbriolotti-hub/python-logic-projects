# Python Logic Projects 🐍

Welcome to my learning journey! This repository contains small projects and exercises where I practice Python fundamentals.

## 🕹️ Project 1: Guess the Number Game
A classic interactive game where the computer thinks of a secret number and the user has limited attempts to find it.

### Key Learnings:
- **Control Flow:** Using `if/elif/else` for game logic.
- **Loops:** Implementing `while` loops for continuous gameplay.
- **Library Integration:** Using `randint` from the `random` module.
- **User Input:** Validating and processing data from the console.

### How to run:
```bash
python guess_the_number.py
